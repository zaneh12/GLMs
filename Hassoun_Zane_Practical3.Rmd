## Question 1: 
If the linear predictor for the fit.poisSqrt model is:
ηit = β0 + β1x1it + ... + β26x26it
and the coefficients are listed in the order of the output produced using the code above, which of the
following describes the fit.poisSqrt model when the tide is ’Slack’, in Month 10 and Year 10?

Answer: A) skips from 4 to 13 to 16

## Question 2: Which of the following BEST fits the model 

Answer: A) its a sqrt link not log link or log sqrt or exp
```{r}
#Fitting the model
fit.poisSqrt <- glm(count ~ tidestate + observationhour + DayOfMonth + MonthOfYear +
Year + x.pos + y.pos + Year:x.pos + Year:y.pos, data = EIA,
family = poisson(link = 'sqrt'))
#Getting a summary of the dataset to evaluate
summary(fit.poisSqrt)
```

## Question 3 : If the linear predictor for the fit.pois model is:
ηit = β0 + β1x1it + ... + β26x26it
and the coefficients are listed in the order of the output produced using the code above, which of the
following describes the fit.pois model when the tide is ’Flood’, in Month 1 and Year 12?

Answer: A) Because it fits the numbers right

Question 4: Which of the following BEST describes the fit.pois model?

Answer: e) its a log model so to get it back exp of the log is your lambda. 

```{r}
#Fitting a new model link now is log link

fit.pois <- glm(count ~ tidestate + observationhour + DayOfMonth + MonthOfYear + Year +
x.pos + y.pos + Year:x.pos + Year:y.pos, data = EIA, family = poisson)
#summarising the data

x = 0:(length(fit.pois$coefficients)-1)
View(print(data.frame(x,fit.pois$coefficients)))
```

Instruction:

x.pos + y.pos + Year:x.pos + Year:y.pos, data = EIA, offset=log(area), family = poisson)

call these new models step.poisOff and step.poisOff_BIC respectively (as before set direction =
"both").

Answer: d) only two categories for tidestate
```{r}

step.poisOFF = glm(count ~ tidestate + observationhour + MonthOfYear + Year + x.pos + 
    y.pos + Year:x.pos + Year:y.pos, data = EIA, offset=log(area), family = poisson)
```

```{r}
#Step Function for BIC
small_step_BIC = step(fit.pois_off, direction = "both", k = log(nrow(EIA)))
step.poisOff_BIC = glm(count ~ tidestate + observationhour + MonthOfYear + Year + x.pos + 
    y.pos + Year:x.pos + Year:y.pos, offset=log(area), family = poisson)
```

Instructions: Perform likelihood ratio test results using the Anova function for the step.poisOff_BIC model. 

Queston 8: Based on these results, which of the following is FALSE?

Answer: c) C is wrong anova gives us the type two tests its quite different.

Instructions:Carry out all-possible-subsets selection on the step.poisOff_BIC model using the dredge function and
the default ranking criteria.

Question 11: Based on the step.poisOff_BIC model, what is the predicted value on the scale of the response, when
tidestate=EBB, observationhour=10, month=1, year=11, x.pos=-2061, y.pos=-1158 and the area of the
cell is the mean of the area of all cells in the EIA data set? Report your answer to 3 decimal places.

```{r}
prediction_df = data.frame(tidestate=as.factor("EBB"),
                           observationhour=10,

Answer: TRUE

# Section 2.3 Model Diagnostics

Instructions: In this section we are going to:
• Assess any residual patterns using the residualPlots function in the car library
• Check for any correlation present in the residuals.
• Assess what we have learned from this modelling process with reference to our research questions.
Based on the analysis from the previous section update your model dropping insignificant covariates and/or
interaction terms.

```

Instructions: Make a plot of observed vs fitted. 

Question 17: Which of the following statements is FALSE?

Answer: c) is false cuz we did log transform so there cant be
```{r}

plot_dta_17 = data.frame("Observations" = EIA$count, "Fitted_Values" = step.poisOffOD$fitted.values)

ggplot(data = plot_dta_17, aes(x = Observations, y = Fitted_Values)) + 
  geom_point()+geom_abline(intercept=0,slope=1,color="red")
```


```{r}
phi_hat = summary(step.poisOffOD)$dispersion
scaled_resid =  (EIA$count-plot_dta_17$Fitted_Values)/sqrt(phi_hat*plot_dta_17$Fitted_Values)

ggplot(data = plot_dta_17, aes(x = Fitted_Values, y = scaled_resid))+

Answer: C)
